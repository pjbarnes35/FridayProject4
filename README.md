# Madlib Notes
 Here's how the code works:

-1 The get_word function prompts the user for a specific word and returns the input.
-2The mad_lib function prompts the user for all the words needed for the story.
-3It then constructs the story using f-strings, incorporating the words provided by the user.
-4Finally, it displays the completed story with some visual separators for clarity.
You can run this code, and it will prompt you for the words needed to fill in the Mad Lib, then display the completed story.
